## 📝Notes

> These notes are updated on regular basis

<!--TODO: Table of Contents -->

<br>

### Variables

- Names of variables can have letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot
  start with numbers (it can start with underscores). Python will give you a
  SyntaxError if you use anything else that is not allowed.

<br>

### Expressions vs Statements

- Expressions produce a value and are often found inside statements

- Statements perform actions and are executed sequentially. They control the
  flow of the program, define functions and classes, perform assignments, etc.
